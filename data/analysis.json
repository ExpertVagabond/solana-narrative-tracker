  "executive_summary": "Solana is in a paradoxical phase: SOL is down 39% over 30 days with TVL contracting from $8.7B to $6.4B, yet institutional adoption is accelerating faster than ever. WisdomTree, Ondo, and BlackRock have brought $1.3B+ in tokenized RWAs to Solana, while the AI agent economy (led by ai16z and ElizaOS) is creating entirely new on-chain capital flows. Privacy infrastructure and stablecoin micropayments via Coinbase's x402 protocol represent the next frontier. This is a classic builder accumulation phase — the market is down, but the ecosystem has never been more technically productive.",
